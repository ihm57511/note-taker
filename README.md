  No installation is required to use the Note Taker application in a browser. If desired, the application may be cloned from github in order to expand or modify the app. 
  Once cloned onto the user's machine, the required dependencies of "express" and "uuid" may be installed with the comand line `npm i`.   
  ## Usage  
  To use the application, navigate to the notes page by clicking the get started button on the landing page. Once at the notes page, a user may select a note to view the contents, or create a new note by selecting the pencil icon, and then save it to the notes list, by clicking the save button in the upper right corner.
